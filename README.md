## General Info
This project is Hadoop Mini Project that uses Map reduce to get the number of accidents per make and year of the car

## Description
In this project, we need to utilize data from an automobile tracking platform that tracks the history of important incidents after the initial sale of a new vehicle. Such incidents include subsequent private sales, repairs, and accident reports. The platform provides a good reference for second-hand buyers to understand the vehicles they are interested in.

A Mapreduce program needs to be developed to get the number of accident records per make and year of the car.

## Technologies
* Python 2.6.6
* Hortonworks HDP Sandbox 3.0.0

## Setup
Update the below line in the python files to run on Hadoop
#!/usr/bin/env python

## Local Execution
